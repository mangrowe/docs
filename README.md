# Introduction

## About

Created and idealized with the objective of assisting users in the management and monitoring of their organizational goals, through the application of the MOKR Methodology, which is a combination between the [MAnGve Frameworks](http://mangve.org) and [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR). The MOKR ensures that all users who use it walk in the same direction, with clear priorities, at a constant pace. In addition to being a tool that will certainly add value to organizations, MOKR will also help in the identification of talent, since it is possible to visualize those employees who stand out most during all processes.

In this documentation, the user will find all the necessary information to use our software (even without prior knowledge), so that in a few minutes, only by reading the sections of this document, already be using the MOKR in a satisfactory way.

## How it works

Basically what the user will find in the MOKR is the ability to manage the organizational goals in cycles, which are encompassed within <strong>Tides</strong>. These cycles can be strategic, tactical and operational.

Both on the site and in the mobile application, the user can insert their Organizations, add the Cycles (strategic/ tactical/operational) linked to them, and the Teams included in them, in addition to registering the Objectives and with this, the Key Results pertinent to managing and monitoring the progress of such entities with transparency and practicality. You may also give feedback on the Objectives and Key Results or even view feedback given by other team members, the so-called Check-Ins.

::: tip TIDES
Each tide is composed of three waves. The first wave is strategic and in it the processes of Diagnosis and strategic alignment are developed. At the end of this first wave the strategic objectives of the tide must be defined. The second wave has a tactical nature. In this wave the objectives of the previous wave are integrated with the progress of previous tides - Review of the Backlog, transformed into action plans - Planning for action and the team prepared to achieve these goals - Training/Coaching. In the third wave, of operational characteristic, the action plan is put into practice through Interventions and Evaluations that aim to verify the achievement of the established objectives and make necessary improvements for that tide. <i><b>(Source: [Uma Abordagem para o Gerenciamento Estratégico Ágil em Saúde utilizando PES, OKR e MAnGve](https://reer.emnuvens.com.br/reer/article/view/146/47).

## Strategic Cycles

They can be annual or they can have the entire duration of the organization's strategic planning. Example: If the strategic planning of an organization goes from 2020 to 2022, the strategic cycle can follow this time.

## Tactical Cycles

They are quarterly following the OKR concept, but can also be, for example, monthly. Since the quarterly TACTICAL cycles in one year, it is possible to have 4 cycles. Being monthly, we would have 12 cycles. The organization that uses the MOKR is that it will decide the time period of each cycle.

## Operational Cycles

They are where the goals of strategic and tactical cycles are broken down into smaller goals, so they can be completed more easily.
