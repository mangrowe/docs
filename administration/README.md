# Administration

## Business Model

If you have arrived here you should have noticed that MOKR has some functions that are key to it's operation, in this section we will describe some of them so that you can use our system with much more property. But before that, you also need to be aware that there is a hierarchy in creating OKRs and this will be explained now.

To create an OKR, you must have a objective (O) and also have the main results (KR) for this goal to be achieved. Objectives should always be memorable qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspiring and engaging. A objective should motivate and challenge the team. The main results are a set of metrics that measures your progress toward the goal. For each objective, you must have a set of keys results. The best way to exemplify works as an OKR, is a formula by [John Doerr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr) which says:

::: tip FORMULA
I <b>go</b> (O) <b>as measured by</b> (this set of KRs).
:::

Knowing this, for the creation of an OKR using the MOKR, you must have an <b>organization</b> (because it is this organization that determines the objective that it wants to achieve), a <b>team</b> (because it is this team that will work in the KRs linked to the objective created in the past) and lastly, a <b>cycle</b> (which is where you will tell which KRs will be worked by that team in a certain period of time (tide)). It is worth mentioning that for the creation of the team, keys results and objective you will need to name a <b>responsible</b>. But don't worry, all this will be more clarified in the following sections. Meanwhile, we'll further detail the creation of OKRs in the examples section.

## Examples

Imagine that you want to take a vacation trip, in which case a possible OKR would be:

::: tip Example 1
<b>Objective:</b> getting to travel at the end of the year<br>
<b>Keys Results:</b> 
1. save $ 50,00 per month<br>
2. always keep an eye on the prices of airline tickets<br>
3. Decide your destination in advance
:::

Example 1 is a simple example of an OKR, let's increase the complexity a bit. Now, consider a team that wants to increase engagement with a digital service:

::: tip Example 2
<b>Objective: </b> enchant our customers<br>
<b>Keys Results:</b>
1. Reduce revenue churn (cancellation) from X% to Y%<br>
2. Increase Net Promoter Score from X to Y<br>
3. Improve the average weekly visits per active user from X to Y
4. Increase unpaid traffic (organic) from X to Y
5. Improve engagement (users who complete a profile) from X to Y
:::

Once again, having a set of Keys Results helps create a healthy and sustainable OKR. We want to increase weekly visits (example 2), but we want this to be organic, not through increased marketing spend. Keys Results are crucial. More than that, they define what we mean by "Enchanting our customers", for example. A second team or company could use this same Objective with different Keys Results. <i><b>(Source: [Felipe Castro](https://goo.gl/Ei6ZG3))</b></i>. Now let's see how it all works inside the MOKR.

## Creating a User

To create a user, select the Users option in the side menu. You will be redirected to the page that contains list of all users already created on the system. Right after that, select the create button, as shown in the image below.

<img src="https://goo.gl/97ybdB">

After you select the create button, you will go directly to the user creation page. Fill in the fields and select the save button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/85N78w">

After that, you can already see the newly created user in the system user list:

<img src="https://goo.gl/Pn1TVx">

## Creating an Organization

Select the Organizations menu in the side menu, after the create button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/2qxdct">

After that fill in the field with the name of the organization you want to create and select the save button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/K8UCbE">

You can now view the new organization created in the list of system organizations:

<img src="https://goo.gl/XXYQHX">

## Creating an Organizational Unit

Select Organizational Unit from the side menu then select the new button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/DVGgyi">

You'll see a new interface with the title field, parent organizational unit (which is the organization you created earlier), horizontal and vertical weight. Fill in the title field and select the parent organization unit. If you want to change the weights, change them according to what you want, after that select the save button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/muH6kj">

::: warning WEIGHTS
The weights are how you want to distribute the percentage of each goal in each organizational unit. For example, in the default scenario (with horizontal weight 40 and vertical weight 60 as in the image above) it means that the objectives of the parent organizational unit if completed will represent 40% (with a maximum of 100%) and the children of that unit if have completed their objectives, accounted for 60%.
:::

After saving, you will see the list with the organizational units you created:

<img src="https://goo.gl/Sqi7XU">

In addition, you can still select the organization chart button: 

<img src="https://goo.gl/tbTyh4">

And view the hierarchical structure of the organization in the form of a tree:

<img src="https://goo.gl/iJSXrG">

## Creating a Team

Select in the side menu the option Times, you will see the list with all the teams that already are registered in the system. After that, select the new button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/5M5So5">

Fill in the fields and select the save button. Do not forget, that a team needs a manager and collaborators, as shown in the image below:

<img src="https://goo.gl/wVeqbt">

After this process, you can view the team you just created in the list of all system teams:

<img src="https://goo.gl/vtbzhX">

## Creating a Cycle

To create a cycle, select the Cycles option in the side menu, after that select the create button. As with all other menus, you can see the listing of all the cycles created in the system, with the image shown:

<img src="https://goo.gl/ag3xL1">

After you have selected the create button, fill in the Title, Cycle (the cycle you are creating, associated cycle), description, start and end date fields, then select the save button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/KTHh4j">

You can now view the cycle you just created in the list of all system cycles:

<img src="https://goo.gl/KVGheC">

## Creating Objectives, Key Results and Check-Ins

In order to create a objective, it is mandatory that information about Users, Teams, Organizational Unit and Cycle have already been previously registered in the system, without them, you will not be able to create a objective correctly. Knowing this, to create a goal, go to the Objectives side menu and select the create button. Note that the list of created goals is also shown below:

<img src="https://goo.gl/25Y5f1">

After that, you will be redirected to the objective creation page, where you must fill in the fields of it, except for the field 'Objective bound', this may be blank at the time of creating the objective, as exemplified by the image:

<img src="https://goo.gl/XouXGE">

After the fields are filled in, click Save and your objetive will be created. Of note, the creation of Tags for the objective, you can do searches for tags previously created and associated with the objectives, this will be shown a little later. In the meantime, you can see that after you click Save you will be redirected to the Key Results addition page:

::: warning KEY RESULTS
If you've come this far, you know that the Key Findings are critical to how the system works. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that you register them soon after creating your Objectives. Key Results are quantitative and indicate the progress of each Objective, which will be reflected in the progress of each Oranizational Unit and which will have an impact on the progress of the Organization as a whole.
:::

Click Objective info and view this result:

<img src="https://goo.gl/xcEy7F">

> Note the Edit button in the lower right corner of the page. This gives you the ability to edit the objective you are viewing.

Click Add and you will be redirected to the Key Results registration page. Fill in the fields and note that the key results can be numeric:

<img src="https://goo.gl/7ZJNev">

Or they can be booleans:

<img src="https://goo.gl/ZSyedL">

Regardless of the format you choose, the save button is the final step in creating the key result. After selecting it, you will be redirected to this page:

<img src="https://goo.gl/DR4Wqt">

Note the newly created key result and the progress indicator, which will change according to the Check-ins that each key result will receive. To check in a key result, click on the desired key result and get this result:

<img src="https://goo.gl/HnyqEp">

Select the check-in button, then on the Check-In page, select the New button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/FhXcvV">

Note that the current and target fields are already populated according to what you reported in the key result creation. Fill in the current field, description and confidence level, then select the save button.

::: warning TRUST LEVEL
It's how reliable the information given at check-in is.
::: 

<img src="https://goo.gl/nRUDNH">

After you save, you will be redirected back to the Check-Ins page and you may notice that the check-ins evolution graph has changed, and below it, a list containing the check-in information is displayed, the progress and the level of confidence:

<img src="https://goo.gl/taqmXn">

::: warning IMPORTANT
Note that on the same page, you can see the key result again by selecting the Key Result button next to the New button and also clicking the camera on the top of the graph to download the evolution chart.
:::

We will click on the Key Result button located on the Check-Ins page and we will be redirected to this page:

<img src="https://goo.gl/HLh2wD">

Note that on this page, you can view all the key result information again, including a progress bar indicating the percentage where the key result is. The buttons in the lower right corner give you the option to re-check, remove the key result, refresh it, and re-view the object to which the key result being viewed belongs. Let's click on the goal button, and we will have this page result:

<img src="https://goo.gl/QWcQLL">

You may note that objective progress has changed according to the current progress of the key outcome. The progress of the goal will vary according to the amount of key results.

## Reporting Impediments

In the preview interface of a key result, you will find the Impediments button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/QyRykn">

Select it and get this result:

<img src="https://goo.gl/fTpXw9">

The page of impediments counts on a list of all the impediments for that key result, with the Result of Key and with the button Create, that is the way that we will take now. Select the Create button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/6t8ZEg">

Fill in the fields and note that you can also upload a file (if necessary and desired), after that select the Save button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/H1jM5G">

When filling in the information, note that another Requested has been selected, and that the situation of the impediment is now "Pending". This situation will change until the impediment is with the situation equal to "Closed". You can also once again attach some file that helps you sort out or exemplify why you are with this impediment. Click Save to be redirected to the Impediment page:

<img src="https://goo.gl/m1JocQ">

## Searching for objectives

You have the option to search for objectives by Cycle, Title, Organizational Unit, Responsible and by Description of the objective. To do this, select the Objectives menu and then the Search button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/4v3gWe">

Let's now search for the objective we created in the section where you learned how to create objectives:

<img src="https://goo.gl/rmqEKW">

Note that we use the title as a filter for our search, but you could use any other field as a filter. Even if you only use the title, as a result of the search, you can still see the Cycle and Level.

## Searching tags

Find the tags you've created and have associated them with your objectives in a practical way. Still in the Objectives menu, search for the Tags button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/Ci9CgR">

When you click the button, you will see a list with all the tags previously created, we will search for the tag 'objetivoestrategico' and see the result:

<img src="https://goo.gl/dnMiG2">

As you can see, the search returned the tag we wanted. You can also click on the search result and get that page as a result:

<img src="https://goo.gl/6A2ZcW">

In the end, you've just searched for a objective for a tag, in a different way.

## Viewing the progress of all the objectives of an organization

You can access this functionality by accessing the Objectives menu and selecting the objective list button:

<img src="https://goo.gl/JpvybY">

When you click the button, this is the page displayed:

<img src="https://goo.gl/Zgdqrm">

Note that the smaller rectangle highlights the overall progress of the organization's objectives. The larger rectangle highlights an Objective and their respective Key Findings. If you click on one of the key results, you will be redirected to make a new Check-In on the selected result.

## Printing screen with objectives progress of an organization

You can also print the page that was exemplified in the previous section. When you access the Objectives menu, clicking on the list button, you will have the print button available:

<img src="https://goo.gl/vNGUjW">

After clicking the print button, your browser will open the print manager. Note the highlight for the page to print:

<img src="https://goo.gl/iLEZ49">

## Dashboard initial

You can tell by logging in to the system that the MOKR home page is made up of two components: one with the organizational progress chart and one containing the latest system updates.

::: warning IMPORTANT
The latest updates serve to show to all users the modifications that were made, by whom they were made and when they were made in Teams, Objective and Key Result.
:::

Look at the image below:

<img src="https://goo.gl/QkXvsg">

Now let's create a Objective, so you can see how the latest updates work. Note that after the creation of the new target,the last updates component has automatically been updated:

<img src="https://goo.gl/tSKJkz">

Now we're going to check in on one of the key results of the new objective you've created, so you'll realize that the progress chart will also automatically update:

<img src="https://goo.gl/P2c9jR">

You may notice the change in the progress of OU Example and Org Example. So every time you change you check in, you have the progress automatically changed and you will always know how the performances of any organizational unit and also the organization as a whole are.

## Backing up

Backing up your system database is for you to keep the information that is already stored in your database with you. You can make this backup inside the system quite simply and can still download the file generated in the backup. To back up, you will click on the gear located in the upper right corner, as shown in the image:
