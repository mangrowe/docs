# Administration

## Business Model

If you have arrived here you should have noticed that MOKR has some functions that are key to it's operation, in this section we will describe some of them so that you can use our system with much more property. But before that, you also need to be aware that there is a hierarchy in creating OKRs and this will be explained now.

To create an OKR, you must have a objective (O) and also have the main results (KR) for this goal to be achieved. Objectives should always be memorable qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspiring and engaging. A objective should motivate and challenge the team. The main results are a set of metrics that measures your progress toward the goal. For each objective, you must have a set of keys results. The best way to exemplify works as an OKR, is a formula by [John Doerr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr) which says:

::: tip FORMULA
I <b>go</b> (O) <b>as measured by</b> (this set of KRs).
:::

Knowing this, for the creation of an OKR using the MOKR, you must have an <b>organization</b> (because it is this organization that determines the objective that it wants to achieve), a <b>team</b> (because it is this team that will work in the KRs linked to the objective created in the past) and lastly, a <b>cycle</b> (which is where you will tell which KRs will be worked by that team in a certain period of time (tide)). It is worth mentioning that for the creation of the team, keys results and objective you will need to name a <b>responsible</b>. But don't worry, all this will be more clarified in the following sections. Meanwhile, we'll further detail the creation of OKRs in the examples section.

## Examples

Imagine that you want to take a vacation trip, in which case a possible OKR would be:

::: tip Example 1
<b>Objective:</b> getting to travel at the end of the year<br>
<b>Keys Results:</b> 
1. save $ 50,00 per month<br>
2. always keep an eye on the prices of airline tickets<br>
3. Decide your destination in advance
:::

Example 1 is a simple example of an OKR, let's increase the complexity a bit. Now, consider a team that wants to increase engagement with a digital service:

::: tip Example 2
<b>Objective: </b> enchant our customers<br>
<b>Keys Results:</b>
1. Reduce revenue churn (cancellation) from X% to Y%<br>
2. Increase Net Promoter Score from X to Y<br>
3. Improve the average weekly visits per active user from X to Y
4. Increase unpaid traffic (organic) from X to Y
5. Improve engagement (users who complete a profile) from X to Y
:::

Once again, having a set of Keys Results helps create a healthy and sustainable OKR. We want to increase weekly visits (example 2), but we want this to be organic, not through increased marketing spend. Keys Results are crucial. More than that, they define what we mean by "Enchanting our customers", for example. A second team or company could use this same Objective with different Keys Results. <i><b>(Source: [Felipe Castro](https://goo.gl/Ei6ZG3))</b></i>. Now let's see how it all works inside the MOKR.

## Creating a User

To create a user, select the Users option in the side menu. You will be redirected to the page that contains list of all users already created on the system. Right after that, select the create button, as shown in the image below.

::: warning WEIGHTS
The weights are how you want to distribute the percentage of each goal in each organizational unit. For example, in the default scenario (with horizontal weight 40 and vertical weight 60 as in the image above) it means that the objectives of the parent organizational unit if completed will represent 40% (with a maximum of 100%) and the children of that unit if have completed their objectives, accounted for 60%.

After saving, you will see the list with the organizational units you created:
