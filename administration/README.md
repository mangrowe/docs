## Business Model

If you have arrived here you should have noticed that MOKR has some functions that are key to it's operation, in this section we will describe some of them so that you can use our system with much more property. But before that, you also need to be aware that there is a hierarchy in creating OKRs and this will be explained now.

To create an OKR, you must have a objective (O) and also have the main results (KR) for this goal to be achieved. Objectives should always be memorable qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspiring and engaging. A objective should motivate and challenge the team. The main results are a set of metrics that measures your progress toward the goal. For each objective, you must have a set of keys results. The best way to exemplify works as an OKR, is a formula by [John Doerr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr) which says:

::: tip FORMULA
I <b>go</b> (O) <b>as measured by</b> (this set of KRs).
:::

Knowing this, for the creation of an OKR using the MOKR, you must have an <b>organization</b> (because it is this organization that determines the objective that it wants to achieve), a <b>team</b> (because it is this team that will work in the KRs linked to the objective created in the past) and lastly, a <b>cycle</b> (which is where you will tell which KRs will be worked by that team in a certain period of time (tide)). It is worth mentioning that for the creation of the team, keys results and objective you will need to name a <b>responsible</b>. But don't worry, all this will be more clarified in the following sections.
