But before that, you also need to be aware that there is a hierarchy in creating OKRs and this will be explained now.</p> <p>To create an OKR, you must have a objective (O) and also have the main results (KR) for this goal to be achieved. Objectives should always be memorable qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspiring and engaging. A objective should motivate and challenge the team. The main results are a set of metrics that measures your progress toward the goal. For each objective, you must have a set of keys results. The best way to exemplify works as an OKR, is a formula by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Doerr<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> which says:</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">FORMULA</p> <p>I <b>go</b> (O) <b>as measured by</b> (this set of KRs).</p></div> <p>Knowing this, for the creation of an OKR using the MOKR, you must have an <b>organization</b> (because it is this organization that determines the objective that it wants to achieve), a <b>team</b> (because it is this team that will work in the KRs linked to the objective created in the past) and lastly, a <b>cycle</b> (which is where you will tell which KRs will be worked by that team in a certain period of time (tide)). It is worth mentioning that for the creation of the team, keys results and objective you will need to name a <b>responsible</b>. But don't worry, all this will be more clarified in the following sections. Meanwhile, we'll further detail the creation of OKRs in the examples section.</p> <h2 id="examples"><a href="#examples" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Examples</h2> <p>Imagine that you want to take a vacation trip, in which case a possible OKR would be:</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Example 1</p> <p><b>Objective:</b> getting to travel at the end of the year<br> <b>Keys Results:</b></p> <ol><li>save $ 50,00 per month<br></li> <li>always keep an eye on the prices of airline tickets<br></li> <li>Decide your destination in advance</li></ol></div> <p>Example 1 is a simple example of an OKR, let's increase the complexity a bit. Now, consider a team that wants to increase engagement with a digital service:</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Example 2</p> <p><b>Objective: </b> enchant our customers<br> <b>Keys Results:</b></p> <ol><li>Reduce revenue churn (cancellation) from X% to Y%<br></li> <li>Increase Net Promoter Score from X to Y<br></li> <li>Improve the average weekly visits per active user from X to Y</li> <li>Increase unpaid traffic (organic) from X to Y</li> <li>Improve engagement (users who complete a profile) from X to Y</li></ol></div> <p>Once again, having a set of Keys Results helps create a healthy and sustainable OKR. We want to increase weekly visits (example 2), but we want this to be organic, not through increased marketing spend. Keys Results are crucial. More than that, they define what we mean by &quot;Enchanting our customers&quot;, for example. A second team or company could use this same Objective with different Keys Results. <i><b>(Source: <a href="https://goo.gl/Ei6ZG3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Felipe Castro<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>)</b></i>.

This is due to the change in result type, as we opted for the Boolean option and marked &quot;To do&quot;, progress will not progress until you receive a check-in. Now, edit a check-in. Navigate to a key result, and select the check-in button, you will see the list with all the check-ins of the selected key result:</p> <img src="https://goo.gl/FSqANH"> <p>We will select the highlighted check in the image above and then we will get the page displayed below:</p> <img src="https://goo.gl/SE2Zht"> <p>Let's edit the description, progress, and confidence level:</p> <img src="https://goo.gl/ntBmfJ"> <p>After selecting the Refresh button, as the image demonstrates, your Check In will be edited.</p> <h2 id="cloning-a-objective"><a href="#cloning-a-objective" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cloning a Objective</h2> <p>In MOKR, you can also clone a objective.
